//! Low-level devicemapper configuration of the running kernel.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Linux's devicemapper allows the creation of block devices whose
//! storage is mapped to other block devices in useful ways, either by
//! changing the location of its data blocks, or performing some
//! operation on the data itself. This is a low-level facility that is
//! used by higher-level volume managers such as LVM2. Uses may
//! include:
//!
//! * Dividing a large block device into smaller logical volumes (dm-linear)
//! * Combining several separate block devices into a single block
//!   device with better performance and/or redundancy (dm-raid)
//! * Encrypting a block device (dm-crypt)
//! * Performing Copy-on-Write (COW) allocation of a volume's blocks
//!   enabling fast volume cloning and snapshots (dm-thin)
//! * Configuring a smaller, faster block device to act as a cache for a
//!   larger, slower one (dm-cache)
//! * Verifying the contents of a read-only volume (dm-verity)
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Before they can be used, DM devices must be created using
//! `DM::device_create()`, have a mapping table loaded using
//! `DM::table_load()`, and then activated with
//! `DM::device_suspend()`. (This function is used for both suspending
//! and activating a device.) Once activated, they can be used as a
//! regular block device, including having other DM devices map to
//! them.
//!
//! Devices have "active" and "inactive" mapping tables. See function
//! descriptions for which table they affect.
